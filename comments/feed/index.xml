					<description><![CDATA[Made this stu &#038; loved it.  I also added a couple of different spices, such as, curry, nutmeg, garam malasa.  Also didn’t have sweet white potatoes, so used yams.
Flavours with bison are amazing..
Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great baseline recipe that is very versatile. I use just a regular egg and I have used this to recipe to make several versions. I have made vanilla, chocolate/coconut, blueberry and lemon. I make more of a muffin version instead of a donut but I have made both. All the flavors are a hit and it seems that I am making a different flavor every night. The mochi comes out so good that a glaze is not necessary. In fact I omit the glaze all together. This recipe is a keeper, I have already saved it. Thanks for finding a paleo version. My family loves it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These were incredible! So juicy and flavorful. Definitely wish I had made extra kale sauce— next time! I served them with steamed broccoli and some seasoned rice I had leftover from  an instant pot meal earlier in the week. These will definitely be on repeat!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t notice the existence of this recipe until Stephanie brought this up at her recent podcast interview.  It was time consuming to slice the sirloin cap (is sirloin cap same as sirloin?) as well as the cremini mushrooms.  However, the reward is mouthwatering morish comfort food that my family approved!  I&#039;m glad I gave this a whirl as I would have never thought I like beef stroganoff and now it will be in my repertoire!!  Thanks, Stephanie!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It tastes like yellow cake! These lil’ cakes are so good. I def wouldn’t recommend them as a breakfast, but as a sweet treat to celebrate some sort of occasion. I used a very black and mushy plantain and one that had just started turning mainly black from yellow. The tops got a wee bit burnt at the 40min mark so I’ll need to keep a closer eye on them in the future since sweet plantains can burn so quickly. I’m excited to make this again for a birthday of some sort and maybe even create a topping for them.]]></description>
