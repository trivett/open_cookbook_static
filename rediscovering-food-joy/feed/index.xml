					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/rediscovering-food-joy/#comment-13&quot;&gt;Alison&lt;/a&gt;.

Wow, thank you for your kind comment and for reaching out. It means a lot to me, especially to connect with a fellow allergic person! Food anxiety is definitely such a big issue when dealing with allergies and it is hard to understand until you encounter it personally. I hope to keep touching on these specific allergy topics and continue to raise awareness. Take care!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A fellow allergic person here (card and EpiPen carrying). You write beautifully. I think the notion of food anxiety is so difficult to explain to someone who hasn’t gone through it, and I’m grateful for people like you who take the time to speak out both about it and what you’ve been through.  I look forward to reading more. Have a great weekend!]]></description>
