					<description><![CDATA[I made these today and we really loved them. Going to keep them in my rotation and try to keep on hand to go with soups or as a snack. Thank you so much - it&#039;s not easy to find a legit savoury muffin recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Delicious!  I was tempted to add a tad sweetener but so happy I didn&#039;t.  I have introduced eggs so I used 1 egg instead of gelatin.  Our grocery store sells butternut squash cut into cubes so I just threw those on a baking sheet and oven baked them first.  Maybe that &quot;sweetened&quot; the muffins.  I love the dry ingredient mix as the muffins were soft and yummy.  I&#039;m thinking of trying your dry flour mix for banana muffins.  Mashed bananas (instead of squash) and add cinnamon and allspice.  This is the first bread/muffin recipe that actually looks and tastes like muffins. Thanks for the recipe.]]></description>
