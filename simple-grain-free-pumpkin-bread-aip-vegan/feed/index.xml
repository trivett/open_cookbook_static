I am sorry to hear the recipe didn&#039;t turn out as you wanted. Perhaps it was too crumbly due to difference in oven temperature (every oven is a bit different) or another variable. If you want to try it again, you can try adding in a little more pumpkin puree since it acts as a binder or you can add a gelatin egg. Hopefully the flavor was at least enjoyable for you.]]></description>

Hi Fanny, thanks for reaching out! I think sweet potato puree should work just fine. It will have a different flavor but I imagine it will still taste great. Let me know how it turns out for you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I will try this today. I do not have pumpkin at hand though, but sweet potato. Since the texture is somewhat the same, and they are both sweet, I hope they are interchangeable]]></description>
