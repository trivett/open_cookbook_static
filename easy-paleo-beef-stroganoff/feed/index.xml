					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t notice the existence of this recipe until Stephanie brought this up at her recent podcast interview.  It was time consuming to slice the sirloin cap (is sirloin cap same as sirloin?) as well as the cremini mushrooms.  However, the reward is mouthwatering morish comfort food that my family approved!  I&#039;m glad I gave this a whirl as I would have never thought I like beef stroganoff and now it will be in my repertoire!!  Thanks, Stephanie!]]></description>

Thank you for reaching out and I love hearing that you enjoy the website! Sorry to hear that coconut seems to be a trigger for you. Unfortunately, this recipe relies on the coconut cream for the added richness to the sauce. You could try increasing the broth and adding a bit more arrowroot powder to see if that works but it will have a different flavor and consistency. Be sure to search my website for coconut-free options. I will keep adding coconut-free recipes since it is definitely a trigger for many!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello! I am loving your website and recipes! I am new to the AIP diet, and trying to broaden my meals a bit. Coconut seems to be somewhat of a trigger for my symptoms, is there any way this could be made without / with a substitute? Thank you very much in advance &#060;3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this the other evening and it was absolutely delicious. It was savory, rich and I was thrilled the recipe didn’t use garlic or onions. I did use garlic oil to sauté the mushrooms in and I paired it with cassava pasta. Thanks for your creation.]]></description>
