Thank you Nancy! I am so happy to hear how much you enjoy the cookie recipe. I love the idea of adding cinnamon! I am going to give this a try the next time I make a batch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These were absolutely delicious!  In my year on AIP, I have had only had cookies as cheats.  I am so excited to have these to eat without shame!  They were easy to make and so extremely good.  I had everything on hand and made them on a whim, and I&#039;m glad I did.  my only diversion from the recipe was a little sprinkle of cinnamon.  They are rather fragile, so no dunking into your tea :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this recipe but I felt I was having issues with cassava flour, so I tried replacing it with about 3/4 of 1/2 a cup of coconut flour, and around 1/4 of 1/2 a cup of arrowroot starch. The texture is a little crumbly, crumblier than what the cassava flour probably wouldâ€™ve been but it doesnâ€™t bother me, the taste is amazing. Thank you for this Tigernut cookie recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These cookies are INCREDIBLE!  They can be made soft or crunch (add a few minutes to bake time for crunch).  I actually prefer them to &quot;regular cookies&quot; that have sugar, butter, and all purpose flour.  These make me feel good because I know that every ingredient is nutritious and doing something for my body.  I bake them weekly because I cannot live without them now :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t usually post reviews and I am usually hesitant to try recipes that are unrated and unreviewed. With that said I was so pleasantly surprised!  My AIP journey is now on its seventh month and this is the first cookie recipe that I have tried that actually  tastes just like a regular cookie!  Thank you so much for such a great recipe. This has become my go-to!  My husband was even surprised it was AIP!]]></description>
