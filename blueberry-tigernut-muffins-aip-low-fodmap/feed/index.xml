Thank you for leaving the review. I love hearing that both you and your wife enjoyed the recipe. I’ll have to try the batter in a loaf pan as you suggested – sounds like a great idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can eat just about anything I want, but my wife can no longer eat some of her favorite foods, including many breads, cakes and pastas. We both like to cook, and I helped her with making these muffins.

Once we had acquired all the ingredients, which did require some online ordering, we found that following the recipe is almost as simple as making standard muffins. We have made these several times now. The first time we followed the recipe exactly, but since my wife can eat eggs, we have modified the recipe to use a real egg instead of the egg substitute. We have used both a standard full size convection oven and a smaller countertop Brava smart oven, set for blueberry muffins, to bake them. In all cases the results have been excellent. The muffins are flavorful and the texture is similar to a sour cream muffin.

Recently for my wife&#039;s birthday I decided to make her birthday cake using this recipe. I used a 4&quot;x8&quot; loaf pan lightly coated with avocado oil, lowered the oven temperature to 325°F, and baked it for about 35 minutes. My wife was delighted.

P.S. While I can easily add these to my list of favorite muffins, and even though my wife always wants to share them with me, sometimes I do feel a bit guilty when eating one rather than saving it for her.]]></description>
