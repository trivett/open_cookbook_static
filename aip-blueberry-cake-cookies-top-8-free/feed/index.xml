Hi Olivia, thank you so much for your review! It makes me so happy to hear how much you enjoyed the blueberry cookies. I also love keeping a stash in the freezer! A perfect snack for when you need something sweet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a thing for purple <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="üíú" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and I knew I had to make these <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f970.png" alt="ü•∞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 
I love how they are made of wholesome ingredients and still taste pretty delectable and rustic at the same time.  As soon as I restock my coconut flour., I would need to replenish them for my freezer stash!  It satisfies my sweet tooth craving and I would just pop one in the microwave when needed <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f90c-1f3fc.png" alt="ü§åüèº" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f48b.png" alt="üíã" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
Thanks, Stephanie!]]></description>

Hi Taryn, so sorry to hear that the cookies melted. This might be a combination of a couple of things - either not enough coconut flour or a bit too much coconut oil. Unfortunately, coconut flour tends to be a bit finicky with how you measure it. The next time I make the cookies, I will measure it in grams and add this to the recipe. Hopefully this will help you get the right texture!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this recipe. It looks amazing. I rarely eat sweet things with my AIP diet, but this looks mighty tasty. I&#039;ve added it to my Healthy Psoriasis Recipes Pinterest board too. ;)]]></description>
