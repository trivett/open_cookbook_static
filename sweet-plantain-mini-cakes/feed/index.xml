					<description><![CDATA[It tastes like yellow cake! These lil’ cakes are so good. I def wouldn’t recommend them as a breakfast, but as a sweet treat to celebrate some sort of occasion. I used a very black and mushy plantain and one that had just started turning mainly black from yellow. The tops got a wee bit burnt at the 40min mark so I’ll need to keep a closer eye on them in the future since sweet plantains can burn so quickly. I’m excited to make this again for a birthday of some sort and maybe even create a topping for them.]]></description>

Hi Tara, I would recommend avoiding squash or pumpkin since it might add too much moisture compared to a ripe plantain. Instead, I would try out a banana instead if you have one available to you. Let me know how the recipe works out for you!]]></description>

Hi Rachel, I haven&#039;t tried eggs so I can&#039;t speak from personal experience but I think it should work just fine. I would try replacing the gelatin egg with one egg and let me know how it works for you.]]></description>
