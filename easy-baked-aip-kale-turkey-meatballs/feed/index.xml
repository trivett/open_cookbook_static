					<description><![CDATA[These were incredible! So juicy and flavorful. Definitely wish I had made extra kale sauce— next time! I served them with steamed broccoli and some seasoned rice I had leftover from  an instant pot meal earlier in the week. These will definitely be on repeat!!]]></description>

Hi Jo, sorry if there is any confusion. The kale puree is mixed in with the ground turkey and then baked in the oven per the instructions. I had leftover kale puree and used it for photographic purposes.]]></description>
