					<description><![CDATA[These are absolutely amazing! Iâ€™ve made them twice now and literally have to hide them from sight as they are so addictive. Hubby didnâ€™t even realize they were AIP, which is a clear sign of their divine power. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="ðŸ˜‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f970.png" alt="ðŸ¥°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Thanks a million for such a wonderful treat!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[O M G. These are amazing. I used avocado oil since I was concerned my olive oil may be too strong but I want to try them that way now too! I made my own carob chips so used those &#038; and a dash of cinnamon to enhance the oats :) I was wondering if I should chill them before baking. Nope - they&#039;re PERFECT at 10 mins. Crispy edges, chewy centers, very light texture just like a buttery oatmeal cookie... I&#039;m in love. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Since my chips are kinda sweet and miss the semi-bitter taste of real chocolate, I am going to probably just use maple syrup the next time I make these cookies and skip the coconut sugar or just reduce it! :)]]></description>
