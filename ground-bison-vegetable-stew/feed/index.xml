					<description><![CDATA[Made this stu &#038; loved it.  I also added a couple of different spices, such as, curry, nutmeg, garam malasa.  Also didn’t have sweet white potatoes, so used yams.
Flavours with bison are amazing..
Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you - this stew was delicious - first time I’ve ever had bison &#038; thought it would be gamey but it wasn’t.  Only thing is that my stew was not as bright yellow as yours - mine looked more in the muddier side.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made this tonight. Just as written but sans parsley. It’s definitely a two thumbs up on my thumb - o - meter!  A keeper for sure. All at the table agreed. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved this soup!!!! It was amazing!  I could not find puréed butternut squash, but bought a package of chopped squash in the vegetable section, boiled it and smashed it.  Thank you for sharing!  It was perfect for tonight’s cold weather!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this recipe.  I have a severe food sensitivity problem and am limited in what I can eat.  I get tired of the same old things.  I made this with slight modifications and loved it.  It was so nice to have something different.]]></description>
