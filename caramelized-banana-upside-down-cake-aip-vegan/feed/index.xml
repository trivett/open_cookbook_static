					<description><![CDATA[Oh. My. Goodness. This cake is so good!!!! My daughter and I (on AIP DIET) and my husband (eats SAD) all love it. It’s moist and really banana-y with a great texture. I used my 6 inch spring form pan which is perfect. Came out easily and it doesn’t make too much dessert. (we don’t eat a lot of sweets) Thanks for the keeper recipe!]]></description>
