					<description><![CDATA[This is a great baseline recipe that is very versatile. I use just a regular egg and I have used this to recipe to make several versions. I have made vanilla, chocolate/coconut, blueberry and lemon. I make more of a muffin version instead of a donut but I have made both. All the flavors are a hit and it seems that I am making a different flavor every night. The mochi comes out so good that a glaze is not necessary. In fact I omit the glaze all together. This recipe is a keeper, I have already saved it. Thanks for finding a paleo version. My family loves it.]]></description>

Rachel, so happy to hear you enjoyed the mochi donuts! It is great to hear you can tolerate eggs again. I need to make this recipe again soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These donuts are delicious! I love the chewy texture. They are so much like mochi donuts. I have been on AIP for almost a year now and this absolutely satisfied a craving. I have successfully reintroduced eggs and used one medium egg in this recipe in place of the gelatin egg and it worked out nicely. Thank you for a great recipe!]]></description>

Thanks for reaching out - I am not totally sure since I am unable to eat eggs but I would suggest trying the recipe with one egg. Let me know how it turns out for you!]]></description>
